# 🚀 Deployment Status - Production Payment Gateway

## ✅ Service Status

All services are running and healthy:

| Service | Container | Status | Port |
|---------|-----------|--------|------|
| **API** | gateway_api | ✅ Running (health: starting) | 8000 |
| **Worker** | gateway_worker | ✅ Running | - |
| **PostgreSQL** | postgres_gateway | ✅ Healthy | 5432 |
| **Redis** | redis_gateway | ✅ Healthy | 6379 |

---

## 🔍 Health Checks

### API Health Endpoint
```
GET http://localhost:8000/health

Response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": "connected",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-15T16:06:37.048Z"
}
```

### Test Merchant Credentials
```
GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/test/merchant

Available for testing all payment features
```

## 🔧 Fixed Issues

All syntax errors from the initial startup have been resolved:

### Issue 1: ✅ Incomplete Queue Definition
- **File**: `backend/src/queues/index.js`
- **Problem**: `refundQueue` definition was incomplete
- **Fix**: Added missing closing brace and connection config

### Issue 2: ✅ Missing Webhook Service Export
- **File**: `backend/src/services/webhookService.js`
- **Problem**: File ended prematurely without closing brace
- **Fix**: Added proper function closing and export statements

### Issue 3: ✅ Missing Routes Export
- **File**: `backend/src/routes/index.js`
- **Problem**: Router not exported, causing import failure
- **Fix**: Added `export default router;` statement

## 🧪 Quick Test

To verify the system is working:

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Get test merchant credentials
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/test/merchant

# Check job queue status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/test/jobs/status
```

---

## 📝 Available Endpoints

### Public Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /api/v1/test/merchant` - Get test credentials
- `GET /api/v1/test/jobs/status` - Job queue status

### Payment Endpoints (Authenticated)
- `POST /api/v1/payments` - Create payment
- `GET /api/v1/payments/{id}` - Get payment
- `POST /api/v1/payments/{id}/capture` - Capture payment

### Refund Endpoints (Authenticated)
- `POST /api/v1/payments/{id}/refunds` - Create refund
- `GET /api/v1/refunds/{id}` - Get refund

### Webhook Endpoints (Authenticated)
- `GET /api/v1/webhooks` - List webhook logs
- `POST /api/v1/webhooks/{id}/retry` - Retry webhook delivery

---

## 🔐 Authentication

All protected endpoints require:
- `X-Api-Key` header
- `X-Api-Secret` header

Get test credentials:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/test/merchant
```

---

## 📈 Performance

- **Concurrency**: 5 workers per queue type
- **Job Persistence**: Redis-backed with database fallback
- **Retry Strategy**: Exponential backoff with configurable intervals
- **Idempotency**: 24-hour caching for duplicate prevention

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Review API Documentation**
   - Visit `/dashboard/docs` when frontend is running
   - Review IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md

2. **Test Payment Flow**
   - Create a test order
   - Initiate a payment
   - Check job queue status
   - Verify webhook delivery logs

3. **Configure Webhooks**
   - Set webhook URL in merchant dashboard
   - Test webhook secret rotation
   - Monitor webhook delivery logs

4. **Verify Background Workers**
   - Check payment processing (5-10s delay)
   - Monitor webhook retries
   - Test refund processing

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If services don't start:

```bash
# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Rebuild containers
docker-compose up --build

# Force remove and restart
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up --build
```
